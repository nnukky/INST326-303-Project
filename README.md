Our peoject represents a warehouse store where a user will be able to 
find an items location, search the store for a specific item, or add
items to your cart.

There is a required argument when running the project.py file from the 
terminal. You can either type 'store', 'find', or 'buy'. The explanation
of what each argument will do is provided below

-- BUY -- 
To buy an item after knowing its item ID, simply type 'python project.py buy'. Next, enter the item ID you would like to purchase. After entering an item ID, you will be shown what is in your cart along with the total price, as well as a list of suggested items. You may continue to buy items until you do not wish to buy anymore.
